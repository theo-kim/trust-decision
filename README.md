# Email Phishing Trust Examination

This repository contains the experimental setup testing the following experimental prompt: **To what extent do environmental factors affect an individual's ability to identify attempts at email phishing?**

To run the experiment, you may navigate to the live setup at http://trust-decision.herokuapp.com/. NOTE: please allow up to one minute for the site to load as the setup is currently running on a free container which is deactivated upon disuse.
